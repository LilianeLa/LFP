% Test on day 15 of rat SA34.

% Observations: 
% - There are (unfortunately?) many artifacts: 706
% 	Thus, perhaps there are superpositions of slow waves with the artifacts, which cannot ensure a good detection of slow waves. 
% 	(When there is an artifact detected, the algorithm skip the event and doesn't check if it's a slow wave)
% - Only 2 BP has been detected: at 1048 and 2925 s
% - No P300 has been detected.
