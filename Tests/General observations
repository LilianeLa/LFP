SA34: 
- As expected, at day 1 there are no SW just before and after OA.
- Day 8, the SWs just before OA appear in a high number. (Apparition of Bereitschaftspotential?)
- Day 15, there are (unfortunately) very few SWs around the OA; moreover there are many artifacts.   (706 artifacts...) 


SA14: (11 07 2013)
- file 0003: results quite positive: it seems there are many SW just before OA
- file 0004: we don't see any BP but there are only 3 OA 
- We have to examine the other files of SA14
