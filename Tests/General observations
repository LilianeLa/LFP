SA34: 
- As expected, at day 1 there are no SW just before and after OA.
- Day 8, the SWs just before OA appear in a high number. (Apparition of Bereitschaftspotential?)
- Day 15, there are (unfortunately) very few SWs around the OA; moreover there are many artifacts.   (706 artifacts...) 


SA14: (11 07 2013)
- file 0003: results quite positive: it seems there are some SWs just before/after OA (one BP and several P300) for 3 OA.
- file 0004: we don't see any BP/P300 but there are still only 3 OA.
- We have to examine the other files of SA14.
