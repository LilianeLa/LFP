% Test on day 8 of rat SA34.

% Observations: 
% - It seems there are many Bereitschaftspotentials detected (but not all)
% - No P300 has been detected (it seems to be like what Alex said in his thesis Fig.18 p.30 about weeks 1-2: apparition of BP but no P300 yet at this step of self-administration)
